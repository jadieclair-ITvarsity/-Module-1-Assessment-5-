            Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled
            Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home
            and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor
            nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the
            throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure
            that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost
            Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Loki’s people,
            and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested Thor of his magic
            hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as
            Earth.

            Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane
            Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their investigation into
            strange activity near a small New Mexico town. While his brother
            struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to
            ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow
            the Frost Giant king—his real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his
            sleep. Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself to save the town from
            destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to
            full Asgardian power.
