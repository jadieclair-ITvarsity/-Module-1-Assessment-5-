          <p class="description">
            Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the
            effects of gamma radiation on humans, working alongside Dr. Betty
            Ross at a Virginia University lab. Dr. Ross’ father, General
            “Thunderbolt” Ross of the U.S. Army, channeled Banner’s work into a
            program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both
            doctors. When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he
            triggered a fantastic transformation in himself that resulted in an
            immense, hulking figure fueled by his own rage. Having destroyed his
            lab as the creature, and inadvertently harming Ross in the process,
            Banner slipped away to avoid capture and study by the Army and began
            a desperate quest for a cure to his bizarre affliction. As
            intelligent and cerebral as Bruce Banner is, his alter-ego the Hulk
            is a completely physical phenomenon. The green behemoth possesses
            the greatest raw strength of any natural being on Earth, with an
            upper limit that has yet to be fully tested. His leg muscles allow
            him to leap great distances and land without harm, and his skin can
            resist damage from heavy weaponry, as well as the natural elements
            and even unnatural ones. The Hulk has grown somewhat more
            intelligent over the years, beginning with the mind of nearly an
            infant and progressing to what might be described as the personality
            of a toddler. His speech has increased from growls and roars, to one
            or two words at a time, to full sentences, albeit broken and naïve.
            Banner recognizes the Hulk as himself, but often refers to him as
            “the other guy,” while his alter-ego seems to have little love or
            respect for the mild scientist and may not even be cognizant that
            Banner is himself.
